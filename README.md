# Android Support Annotations Demo

Sample project demonstrating several of the Android Support Annotations.

Website: http://patrickhammond.com/Presentation-AndroidSupportAnnotations/

- The `master` branch has unideal code.
- The `better_code` branch has _slightly_ less unideal code demonstrating support annotation usage.
- The `gh_pages` branch is the presentation site.

Recommendation:
Open this project in Android Studio 1.3+ while exploring support annotation usage.

Note:
The code here is far from quality code, but simply meant to highlight a few of the support annotations.
